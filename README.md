# ðŸ¤– Machine Learning App

Let us build a machine learning application with Python and Streamlit. This quickstart application will help you learn 

- [x] Using streamlit widgets
- [x] Deploying application to Streamlit cloud
- [x] Use scikit-learn to do a simple classfication
- [x] Leverage Streamlit's interactivity to do a ML prediction

A step by step guide of this [Zero to Streamlilt](https://snowflake-labs.github.io/zero-to-streamlit/).

## Demo App

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://kameshsampath-ml-app.streamlit.app/)

## Running Locally

You can also run the application locally using VSCode [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container). 

And to try Streamlit in Snowflake(SiS) you need to have Snowflake account and tables,schemas and other resources prepared.
