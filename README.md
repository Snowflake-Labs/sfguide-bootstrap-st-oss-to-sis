# ðŸ¤– Machine Learning App

Let us build a machine learning application with Python and Streamlit. This quickstart application will help you learn 

- [x] Using streamlit widgets
- [x] Deploying application to Streamlit cloud
- [x] Use scikit-learn to do a simple classification
- [x] Leverage Streamlit's interactivity to do a ML prediction

A step by step guide of this [Bootstrapping Your Transition from Streamlit OSS to Streamlit in Snowflake
    (SiS)](https://snowflake-labs.github.io/streamlit-oss-to-sis-bootstrap/).

## Demo App

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://oss-to-sis-bootstrap.streamlit.app/)

## Running Locally

You can also run the application locally using VSCode [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/create-dev-container). 

And to try Streamlit in Snowflake(SiS) you need to have Snowflake account and tables,schemas and other resources prepared.
